# We first need to extract the required data from data dumps hosted by the FPL site:

# https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/elements/: Contains player IDs, names and other general details
# https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/element-summary/{id}: contains detailed stats on footballers


# Modules and import data -------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite) # flattening jsons
library(tictoc) # timing code

# fromJSON flattens the json file
elements <- fromJSON("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/elements/")

# note that 'now_cost' and 'selected_by_percent' will change frequently

# while there are some general stats here (like goal_scored), these aren't split by gameweek
# we only want general details from this json

# Data transformation -----------------------------------------------------

# Issues
# Long player names 
# some players have more than one first name, we want to only select the first one
# this only affects surnames but it's more difficult to arbitrarily select the correct name
